### Operations

* An additional configuration value needs to be passed to CARL. You can do so, for example, via environment variable:
```
OPENDUT_CARL_NETWORK_OIDC_CLIENT_ISSUER_ADMIN_URL=https://keycloak/admin/realms/opendut/
```
The value has to be your Keycloak's Admin URL.

* The environment variable for the Keycloak database's password was renamed from `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to `KEYCLOAK_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
</details>

### Added
* CARL can now require clients to be authenticated.

### Changed
* The health of Clusters marked as deployed is now displayed as yellow in LEA.  
  This is to reflect that determining the actual cluster state is not yet implemented.
